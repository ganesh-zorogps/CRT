üìù Problem Statement:
A company maintains a daily shift schedule for its employees, where each employee is assigned a fixed position in an array based on their order of work on Day 1.

To ensure fairness in work distribution, the company follows a policy where the schedule is adjusted every morning: the first d employees are moved to the end of the schedule, preserving their order.

You are given the list of employee IDs for Day 1 and the value d. Write a program to compute the new schedule after applying this policy.
Input:
schedule = [101, 102, 103, 104, 105]
d = 2

Output:
[103, 104, 105, 101, 102]

Explanation:
Employees 101 and 102 are shifted to the end of the schedule.
